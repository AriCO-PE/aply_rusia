  <h2>Who I am?</h2>
  <p>
 I am a curious person, always learning and constantly evolving. My name is Arian — my mother is Colombian, my father is Peruvian, and I was raised in Peru. I have a deep love for technology, writing, and studying every branch of science — from neuropsychology to the interpretation and analysis of complex texts, especially philosophy. I bring these worlds together through my passion for programming and technology. It may sound unusual, but when you have the heart of a writer, the mind of an engineer, and the soul of an artist, you can achieve extraordinary things.

      <h3>Age & Origin</h3>
     <p>
        I am 20 years old, Colombian and Peruvian, and I was raised in Lima. I completed both my school and university education there, growing up in a family filled with love, support, and unity. Their warmth and the joyful smiles around me shaped a happy and fulfilling childhood.

      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>
        I am an extroverted person, unafraid to face challenges, and curious at heart. I am patient, disciplined, and persistent — a natural leader who wants to guide others, helping them grow while learning from them. Kind, loyal, and cheerful, I carry a smile that defines me, bringing peace and warmth to everyone around me, no matter the situation.

      <h3>Sports</h3>
      <p>
        In my family, we are all very athletic. In fact, my siblings are professional soccer players, and one of them is a FIFA referee in CONMEBOL — it’s super fun! I also played soccer and practiced karate, swimming, and surfing. I love being in the water, especially since I grew up near the sea. Today, I keep myself active by going to the gym and practicing other sports. For me, being active is a core value and principle: a healthy mind lives in a healthy body.

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>
        My mother is Colombian, and she raised me alongside my three siblings in Lima, Peru, with my father. We have always been a close-knit family. We grew up with the values of showing others how important it is to pursue our goals and that achievements come through effort. My siblings became professional athletes, while I was drawn to the intellectual world. Despite our differences, I love them all deeply — because it is our values, principles, and love for family that truly define a good person. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you, Mom and Dad, and my siblings, for shaping me into the person I am today.
